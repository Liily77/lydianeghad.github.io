<h4><strong>Sal's Shipping</strong></h4>

Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

<h4><strong>Magic 8-Ball</strong></h4>

Here is part of the second exercise statement :

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball.

<h4><strong>School Grades Program</strong></h4>

I created a small program that stored grade information, processed them to obtain the total grade and percentage, and does some operations to prepared this information before printing them on screen.

<h4>Human Resources Program</h4>

Our Human Resources department is very busy and they have asked us to help speed up their hiring process.

We'll code a program that decides whether or not to hire a candidate, depending on location and score.

<h4>Password Security</h4>

A client has asked us to check their company's cybersecurity system.

Let's create a program that checks the strength of the client's password. We should also check how long it could take for a hacker to hack into their account if they knew the characters, but not the order, to the password.

<h4>Shopping List App</h4>

Rachel often forgets to purchase some things when she goes to the grocery store. I develop an app to help her manage a shopping list!

<h4>Plant Growth Analysis</h4>

George is concerned with the inconsistent growth of his plant. He wants us to write a program to perform some simple analysis with him.

<h4>Electronics Store</h4>

You work in an electronics store. Your task is to clean and format data that contains information about some devices.

Let's build a Python program to help you with that task!

<h4>Gradebook</h4>

You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.
